//NEVER IN TypeScript

/*
    The never keyword is used to indicate that a function will not return anything, or that a variable can never have a value. The never type is useful for indicating that certain values are impossible. It can help catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime.
*/ 

/*
    USE CASES for never üê∫:
    (i) A function that always throws an error.
    (ii) A function that has an infinite loop.
    (iii) A variable that can never have a value.
*/ 

function throwError(message: string): never{
    throw new Error(message);
}

function infiniteLoop(): never{
    while(true){

    }
}

let x: never;
function neverReturns ():never{
    while(true){

    }
}
