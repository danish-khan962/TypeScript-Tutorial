//TYPE INFERENCE:

/* 
    Type Inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. In other words, if you declare a variable without expilicitly specifying its type, TypeScript will try to infer the type based on the value you assign to it.
